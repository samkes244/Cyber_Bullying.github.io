            Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices like
            cell phones, computers, and tablets. Cyberbullying can occur through
            SMS, Text, and apps, or online in social media, forums, or gaming
            where people can view, participate in, or share content.
            Cyberbullying includes sending, posting, or sharing negative,
            harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. It can include
            sharing personal or private information about someone else causing
            embarrassment or humiliation. Some cyberbullying crosses the line
            into unlawful or criminal behavior.
